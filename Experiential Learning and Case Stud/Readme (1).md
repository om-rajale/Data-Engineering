# üè• Hospital Data Lifecycle (Power BI Project)

This project shows how hospital data travels through its **lifecycle**‚Äîfrom being collected to becoming insights you can actually use.  
We use Power BI to demonstrate each stage with a hospital management example.

## Why Data Lifecycle Matters

Hospitals generate data every single day-patient admissions, doctor details, billing records, and departmental activities.  
But raw data on its own doesn‚Äôt tell much. To make it meaningful, it has to go through the **Data Lifecycle**.  


## The Data Lifecycle in Hospial Scenario

### 1. Capture  
Data is collected from different hospital operations-patients, doctors, billing, and departments.  

### 2. Storage  
Collected data is stored in structured files or tables so it can be worked on later.  

### 3. Processing  
Before analysis, the raw data is cleaned and prepared. Missing details are handled, dates are fixed, and tables are connected properly in Power BI.  

### 4. Analysis  
Once the data is ready, we start asking important hospital questions, such as:  
- How many patients are admitted, discharged, or still under treatment?  
- Which department has the most patients?  
- How many doctors are available and how many patients each one is handling?  
- What is the total hospital revenue?  
- How many beds are occupied vs. available?  

### 5. Visualization  
The answers are shown in an interactive Power BI dashboard with:  
- Cards for key numbers (patients, doctors, revenue, beds)  
- Charts for patient admissions and discharges  
- Department-wise comparisons  
- Doctor-wise distribution of patients  
- Bed occupancy view
